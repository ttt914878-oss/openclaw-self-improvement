### 1) 3-Bullet Summary
*   **Engagement-First Growth:** For accounts starting at zero, high-value replies to niche leaders and peers (100–1,000 followers) are more effective than posting original content alone; aim for 20+ thoughtful replies daily to drive profile visits.
*   **Profile as a Landing Page:** Optimization (clear headshot, value-based bio, and a high-performing pinned tweet) is mandatory; your goal is to convert the profile visits generated by your replies into follows.
*   **Iterative Execution:** Growth from 0 to 100 typically takes 4 weeks of consistent activity (2–4 posts/day + active engagement) and requires monitoring engagement rates and profile visit conversion to refine content pillars.

#### **Daily Checklist for 0-100 Growth:**
1.  **Morning (15m):** Reply to 5–10 recent tweets from "Big" accounts in your niche. Ensure the reply adds value (don't just say "Great post").
2.  **Mid-day (10m):** Post 1 original insight or "how-to" tip related to your niche.
3.  **Evening (20m):** Reply to 10 tweets from "Peer" accounts (those with 50–500 followers). Follow 5 new relevant people.
4.  **Weekly Review:** Every Sunday, check [X Analytics](https://analytics.twitter.com/) to see which tweet drove the most "Profile Visits." Double down on that topic next week.
