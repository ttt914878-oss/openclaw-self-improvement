Based on current growth trends for AI developers on X, here is a research-backed strategy to secure your first 100 followers.

### 1) 3-Bullet Summary
*   **The "Reply-First" Growth Engine:** For accounts with <100 followers, posting original content into a void is ineffective. Growth is primarily driven by spending 80% of your time as a "high-value reply guy," leaving thoughtful, technical comments on posts by major AI influencers (e.g., Andrej Karpathy, Rowan Cheung) to siphon visibility to your profile.
*   **Proof of Build (PoB):** AI builders gain trust through visual evidence. "Building in Public" by sharing raw screen recordings of your terminal, UI prototypes, or specific LLM prompt results acts as a "Proof of Work" that separates you from generic "AI curators."
*   **Niche Profile Optimization:** Your profile must act as a landing page. It should explicitly state what you are building (e.g., "Building a RAG-based agent for X") and include a pinned tweet with a "hook" (a significant technical win or a free resource) to convert profile visitors into followers.

### 3) Action Recommendations
*   **Execute the "20-10-5" Daily Routine:**
    *   **20 High-Value Replies:** Reply to 20 tweets from accounts in the 50k–500k follower range. Do not say "Great post!"; instead, add a technical insight or ask a smart question.
    *   **10 Targeted Follows:** Follow 10 active builders in your immediate sub-niche (e.g., "Local LLMs" or "AI Agents").
    *   **5 Content Interactions:** Quote-tweet one major AI news item with your unique technical "take."
*   **Visual Building Blocks:** Once a week, post a "progress video" (even if it's just 15 seconds) of your current AI project. Use tags like #buildinpublic and #AI.
*   **The "Hook" Pin:** Create a thread about a specific problem you solved while building your AI tool (e.g., "How I reduced latency in my RAG pipeline by 40%"). Pin this to the top of your profile.
*   **Automate Discovery, Not Engagement:** Use tools to track when major AI accounts post, but **never** use automated AI reply bots. The current X community is highly sensitive to "AI-slop" and will block accounts that don't sound human.
